# Token Action HUD TITAN

WIP

First and foremost, thank you to the Community Helpers on Foundry's Discord who provide tireless support for people seeking help with the HUD.
Enormous thanks also goes to the following people for their help in getting the HUD to its current state: Drental, Kekilla, Rainer, Xacus, Giddy, and anyone who has provided advice to any and all of my problems on Discord, as well as all the other developers who make FoundryVTT a joy to use.
